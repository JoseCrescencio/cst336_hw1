                <h2>A bit of History</h2>
                <p>
                    The first iteration of windows OS, in 1985, was intended to 
                    provide a simple GUI for MS-DOS. More functionality was
                    added as the years passed. A file manager, program manager,
                    and printer manager where gradually introduced. In 1995,
                    Windows 95 was released. It focused on network interactions
                    and came packaged with the infamous internet explorer. Later,
                    Windows XP was released in 2001. This release packaged utilities
                    in seperate editions. It also improved the system's application
                    and memory management. Windows Vista followed in 2006, resulting
                    in negative ractions from consumers. It was slower and more 
                    resource intesive than the previous iteration. As a response
                    Microsoft released Windows 7 three years later. This new system
                    was considerably faster. In 2012 Windows 8 brought setting 
                    synchronization and applications as tiles on start screen.
                    In 2015, Microsoft anounced the last iteration of Window OS, 
                    Windows 10. It replaced internet explorer and brought cortana
                    personal assistant.
